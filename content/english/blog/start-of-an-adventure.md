It's finally here! After months of planning and preparation, I am ready to go on an unforgettable adventure together with my faithful four-legged friend, Yuki. Our journey begins in the Netherlands and takes us through Germany and Poland, en route to the beautiful Czech Republic. This is just the beginning of a larger journey through Scandinavia, which we are both eagerly looking forward to. Join us as we explore the open road, discover picturesque landscapes and embrace the freedom of RV life.

## The first frontier
Our journey begins in the Netherlands, where we prepared for a long adventure. After packing the motorhome and checking the route, we are ready to cross the border into Germany. With Yuki next to me in the passenger seat, I feel excited about the experiences ahead.

Germany welcomes us with beautiful highways and well-maintained roads, making our motorhome journey smooth. Along the way, we make stops in quaint towns, enjoying local delicacies and soaking up the local culture.

After exploring the German landscapes, we continue our journey to Poland. The country is known for its rich history and breathtaking natural beauty. We drive through charming villages and pass through vast forests and picturesque lakes.

After a short drive through Poland, we continue into the Czech Republic. Here we are greeted by one of our own vacation cottages; our first stop on this trip.

## A realization
Now that we have arrived in the Czech Republic, it really begins to dawn on us that this is just the beginning of our Scandinavian journey. We look forward to traversing the vast landscapes of Sweden, exploring the fjords of Norway and enjoying the pristine nature of Finland.
